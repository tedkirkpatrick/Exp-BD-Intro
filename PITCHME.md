## Intro to the workshop

Who we are, where we're going

**DAY 1: PREPARATION, INCLUDING GETTING DATA**

**DAY 2: ANALYSIS**

Notes:

General use of HTML

* Use Control&nbsp;+ (on Mac&nbsp;OS Command&nbsp;+) to increase the size of the font
* Use Control&nbsp;0 (on Mac&nbsp;OS Command &nbsp;0) to reset the size to default
* The images (with one exception) will adjust to fit screen width
* The one exception is the wide diagram showing process---see notes
  next to that image for how to present it

Ask for tent cards

One of the first things you do is have participants write their
preferred form of address (first name or title + last name ...)
on their tent card
